Bugs, and known issues:
- The xhtml is written with indentation when debug is activated, but that gives some funky results in page ref layout in for instance the index.
- No elegant error handling when specifying non-existing files for input, styles or template.
- Inline footnotes aren't optimally handled yet. Blockquotes inside footnotes result in invalid XHTML (though epub viewers most likely won't complain)

Future wishes:
- Outputting of PDF.
- Composing of parts and sections based on input fragments (e.g. high granular input control from template).
- Footnotes as sidebars or gathered at bottom of page (as far as possible in epub)
