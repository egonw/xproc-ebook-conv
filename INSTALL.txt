The XProc E-Book Processor is an end-user application. The distribution therefore includes all necessary dependencies, apart from Java Run-Time.

Requirements
------------
- Java Run-Time 1.5 or higher

Included (Java) packages
------------------------
Located under 'lib' folder:
- XMLCalabash 0.9.35
	- Saxon-HE 9.3.0.4J (required by XMLCalabash)
	- Apache Commons Codes 1.3 (required by XMLCalabash)
	- Apache Commons Httpclient 3.1 (required by XMLCalabash)
	- Apache Commons IO 1.3.1 (required by XMLCalabash)
	- Apache Commons Logging 1.1.1 (required by XMLCalabash)
- Epubcheck 1.2 (for ePub validation)
	- Saxon 6.5.5 (required by Epubcheck)
	- Jing version 20091111 (required by Epubcheck)
- Apache XML Commons Resolver 1.2 (for local DTD resolving)

Also included is an XProc extension package:
- grtjn-xproc-utils (for the extension step ut:sys-info, source available under 'src' folder)

Installation
------------
- Unpack the distribution package to a suitable location.
- Make sure 'java' is available from the command-line (by adding it to the PATH environment variable)
- Open a command-box in the root of where you unpacked the E-Book Processor
- Run the following command-line:

	java -cp .;lib\resolver.jar;lib\calabash-0.9.35.jar;lib\grtjn-xproc-utils.jar -Dcom.xmlcalabash.phonehome=false -Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties com.xmlcalabash.drivers.Main -D -E org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.CatalogResolver -U org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.CatalogResolver -c lib/grtjn-xproc-utils.xml -i source=in/mult001mill01_01.xml src\nl\grtjn\xproc\ebook\main.xpl

- This should produce an epub file of the example file 'Millioenenstudien' by 'Multatuli'. It should be written as 'out/mult001mill01_01-default.epub'.
- Windows/DOS users can also use the 'run.bat' file. To do the same as above, call it as follows:

	run.bat in/mult001mill01_01.xml
	
- Call run.bat without parameters for further usage.

DTD references to internet
--------------------------
- If internet access goes through a Proxy server, you may need to add the following parameters to the command-line, just after 'java'. Make sure to replace '...' with suitable values. User and Password can be left out if not applicable:

	-Dhttp.proxyHost=... -Dhttp.proxyPort=... -Dhttp.proxyUser=... -Dhttp.proxyPassword...

- Internet access is usually necessary to access DTDs that are referenced from DOCTYPEs using HTTP references.
- You could also put the dtd with all its modules in the 'dtd' folder, and add an entry to the 'catalog.xml' file in the same directory.
